For this assignment, I plan to create a procedurally generated city with a road on which you can drive a vehicle.
The general design for the city will be based on a layout of modular blocks, similar to the likes of Barcelona or New York City.
As of now, the goal is to implement the system of a procedurally generated road / city, however if all goes to plan I will extend the features of the game to some more exciting things.

As for building models, I think it would be a good idea to create some basic low-poly designs in Blender to capture the kind of style I would like. However, if this is too much of a commitment, I'll refer to the Unity Asset store for them in the meantime. Also, the idea of making each block "float" up to meet the previous end of the road is interesting to me and I feel like it would be a great implementation for the overall feel of the game.

The game manager will control the instantiation of new city blocks based on the car's proximity to the end of the road. If the car is driving fast, then the generation will keep up with it, similarly if it is driving slowly the city generation won't go ahead of it. Perhaps I could design different city areas modules, where different districs of the city stay to the theme of industrial, commericial or residential.

I think this will be quite a challenge to implement efficiently, but it sounds like a very enjoyable project and look forward to seeing how it will end up.
